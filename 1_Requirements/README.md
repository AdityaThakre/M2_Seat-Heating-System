# Seat Heating System
Vehicle cabin temperatures can drop below zero levels during exacting winter conditions. Under such subzero conditions, an vehicle driver could experience confined cooling as his/her unprotected body surfaces (15 to 20%) make contact with the cold seat. In this project, the sensor will intellect is the driver has been placed or not and if the driver settled then he need to set the temperature consequently.

Based on that our supervisor will set the heater to essential temperature. In this project ATmega328 microcontrollers used along with temperature sensor, Push button, Heat generator, LED and etc.

# Features
- Its accomplished of decisive weather the user is exist or not in the vehicle.
- If Passenger was existed in the vehicle it will gives the indication.
- After the suggestion it will regulate the heat.
- Driver and the passenger can have the access to modifying the temperature in the vehicle.
- The passenger can modify the temperature by watching the display as the display is given in the system.

# SWOT Analysis

- Strengths : Low cost system.

- Weakness : Its only pertinent for those countries which are having low temperature.

- Opportunities : It can be implemented by replacing heater by air conditioners so that it will be helpful in all the countries.

- Threats : Not suitable for average or high temperature environment.

# 4W's and 1'H
- WHAT : Passanger Seat and Heat Monitoring System.

- WHERE : Used in automotive industry.

- WHEN :low temperature(winter seasons)

- WHY : Well being for user.

- HOW : Operates by modifying the temperature.
